V"Some assembly required." The words strike fear in the hearts of parents who have struggled to put together toys and of backyard warriors cursing the jigsaw pieces of a new hibachi. But for a growing number of Americans with a screwdriver and some patience, unassembled furniture is that rarity in hard times: an affordable option for sprucing up one's home. Sales of traditional furniture have suffered in the recession, putting pressure on large manufacturers like Ladd Furniture Inc., which just entered the do-it-yourself market, and Drexel Heritage, now a subsidiary of the Masco Corporation. Some retailers have also been hard hit, with Seaman's, for example, filing for bankruptcy protection.

The number was 749.1 million on Sept. 13, the previous reporting date. The decline was the first since July.

Effect of Merger With NCR Most of that decline in the A.T.& T. short position was related to the completion of the company's merger with the NCR Corporation.

VThe number of shares sold short declined slightly at the New York Stock Exchange in the last month but rose to another record at the American Stock Exchange, the exchanges reported yesterday. Merger activity, rather than pessimism about stock prices, appears to have caused some of the largest increases. The Big Board reported that the overall short position for trades through July 7 was 1.039 billion shares, down three-tenths of a percent from a month earlier, when a record of 1.042 billion was set.

The previous high of 166.2 million shares was set on July 15. The short interest for the period a year earlier totaled 120.1 million shares. In the latest period, the short interest on the American Stock Exchange fell 410,078 shares, to 15.1 million shares. A short position can result from the sale of borrowed stock in the hope of buying the same issue at a later date and at a lower price to cover the sale.

aVThe National Association of Securities Dealers yesterday reported a sharp increase of about 10.3 percent in the short interest in actively traded over-the-counter securities in its national market system for the four weeks that ended in mid-October. A total of 293.3 million shares were held short and not yet covered in mid-October, it said, compared with a revised total of 265.9 million in the period that ended in mid-September. The October figure, an increase of 27.4 million shares, represents short-selling in 2,298 stocks; in September the short-selling was spread among 2,311 issues.

VThe New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short and not yet covered in the month ended Nov. 15 increased by 62.6 million, to a record level. The new total is 7.9 percent above the previous record, which was set a month earlier. The Big Board said that as of the November settlement date, a record 850.8 million shares were held in a short position -- sold "short" by investors and not yet covered -- compared with an adjusted total of 788.1 million shares on Oct. 15. The latest figure is equivalent to nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board. Also for the month ended Nov. 15, the American Stock Exchange reported its short sales outstanding rose by 680,700 million shares, to a record total of 81.7 million, an increase of less than 1 percent above the previous record total reported for the period ended Oct. 15. A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and it normally represents speculation that the price of the stock will fall, since a short-seller makes a profit if the stock can be bought at a lower price. Debate Over Meaning Some analysts argue that a big drop in short interest is bullish, because it presumably means that many investors think the stock market will rise. Conversely, they say, a large rise in short interest would be bearish. Other analysts, however, argue that a large "overhang" of shares sold short is really a bullish sign, because those shares must eventually be bought back. In a rising market, short-sellers rushing to cover their positions could thus exert more upward pressure on prices. By this reasoning, a decrease in short interest is bearish. The debate has taken on a new twist in recent years as questions have arisen over the value of short interest as an indicator. That change is primarily the result of short-selling by arbitragers involved in special situations, including proposed or pending takeovers, convertible securities, rights offerings, stock splits or distributions and tenders. Short interest figures may be even less meaningful, some experts say, if large institutional investors use short-selling to hedge risk in their portfolios. Seasonal variations may also skew the short-interest figures. For example, analysts note, there is often additional short-selling in December, related to end-of-the-year tax strategies. The number of shares in which a short position is held by investors is totaled monthly by each exchange, as well as by the National Association of Securities Dealers. The following Big Board stocks showed changes in open short positions of 10,000 shares or more in the recent period: *3*Short Interest Security Name 11/15/90 10/15/90 1838 Bond-Deb Tradng 10,442 0 AAR Corp 86,360 69,250 Abbott Labs* 1,420,148 1,545,892 ACM Govt Income* 238,933 5,370 Acuson Corp* 285,747 182,343 Adams Express* 324,348 313,497 Adobe Resources Corp 29,976 7,766 Advanced Micro Dev* 760,211 615,480 Aetna Life Casualty* 3,198,994 1,546,712 Ahmanson HF* 2,395,585 1,709,527 Air Products Chem* 187,646 151,702 Airborne Freight Cor 98,556 71,820 Alaska Air Group* 412,245 299,046 Albany Int'l Cl A* 125,000 107,200 Alberto Culver Cl B* 233,712 157,867 Albertson's Inc* 515,825 660,298 Alcan Aluminium Ltd.* 9,095,127 394,674 Alexanders Inc* 142,273 104,289 Allegheny Ludlum 87,642 42,949 Allegheny Pwr* 972,243 1,250,818 Allen Group Inc 54,712 68,586 Allergan, Inc.* 169,906 180,900 Alliance Capital Mgt 16,400 0 Alliant Techsystems 40,518 0 Allied-Signal Inc* 306,093 486,409 Allst Mun Inc Opp II 17,400 4,000 Allstate Mun Incm 12,004 1,902 Allstate Muni Prem 25,000 0 AM International* 122,482 134,832 Amdura Corp* 152,433 171,000 Amer Brands* 4,116,297 0 Amer Elec Pwr* 914,440 891,244 Amer Express Co* 3,628,937 3,370,554 Amer Family Corp* 279,296 220,328 Amer General* 215,013 430,810 Amer Health Prop 14,286 34,994 Amer President Co's* 214,856 166,914 Amer Real Estate, LP 1,000 13,600 Amer Savs Bk $1.8125* 202,699 224,299 Amer Stores Co* 130,984 115,452 Amer Tel & Tel* 4,352,238 4,456,819 Amer Waste Svcs Cl A 44,158 12,000 Amerada Hess Corp* 359,219 322,854 American Cyanamid Co* 243,880 306,349 American Intl Group* 1,361,089 1,399,246 American Savings Bk* 597,590 615,439 Ameriscribe Corp* 122,450 147,020 Ameritech* 1,607,976 1,630,808 Ames Dept Stores* 2,362,265 2,725,585 Ametek Inc* 102,922 114,714 Amoco Corp* 1,942,445 2,493,842 AMP Inc* 610,291 542,870 AMR Inc* 1,415,184 1,084,860 AMRE, Inc.* 611,600 649,600 Amsouth Bancorp 20,325 32,097 Anadarko Petroleum* 380,853 839,423 Angelica Corp 22,875 2,162 Anheuser Busch Co* 641,949 622,940 Aon Corp 28,319 4,087 Apache Corp* 354,595 89,375 Archer Daniels* 588,069 714,214 Arctic Alaska Fish* 423,750 324,350 Arkla, Inc* 2,642,224 1,588,771 Armstrong World Ind* 223,194 283,213 Arvin Ind,inc* 344,560 333,529 ASA Limited* 166,497 252,171 Asarco Inc* 103,047 136,337 Ashland Oil* 170,596 237,879 Asia Pacific Fund 27,871 16,171 Asset Invest Corp 37,927 1,365 Associated Natl Gas* 144,388 67,238 Atlantic Energy Inc.* 173,399 192,479 Atlantic Richfield* 1,142,835 1,377,144 Automatic Data Proc* 698,405 821,515 Avery Dennison Corp* 196,576 2,270,631 Avnet Inc 31,000 43,239 Avon Prods $2.00 E-R* 151,900 53,100 Avon Products* 363,667 566,982 Baker Hughes Inc* 1,394,883 1,694,418 Ball Corp 79,947 64,637 Bally Mfg Corp* 8,309,831 7,715,146 Balt Gas & Elec Co* 1,183,998 1,289,928 Baltimore Bancorp* 1,156,550 1,234,200 Banc One Corp* 1,186,119 1,289,911 Banco Cntrl (ADR) 11,664 0 Bandag Inc 82,713 72,025 Bank of Boston Corp* 9,056,380 9,514,488 Bank of New England* 5,851,080 7,919,405 Bank of New York* 928,075 844,749 Bank Tr NY* 1,003,331 944,244 Bankamerica Corp* 2,082,533 1,865,097 Barclays Bank ADR A 12,671 31,249 Barclays Plc (ADR) 300 23,764 Barnett Banks Inc* 2,948,194 1,863,855 Bass Plc (ADR) 26,784 901 Battle Mtn Gold* 260,740 212,850 Bausch & Lomb Inc* 369,423 320,633 Baxter Int'l Cv Exch 15,032 32 Baxter International* 3,643,500 3,850,604 Bear Stearns Co* 976,348 1,400,541 Bearings Inc 46,600 19,550 Beazer Plc (ADR)* 365,250 473,984 Beckman Instruments* 124,669 113,260 Bell Atlantic Corp* 1,850,118 1,405,221 Bellsouth Corp* 1,300,247 1,163,574 Bemis Co Inc 70,732 94,206 Beneficial Corp* 580,145 517,883 Benetton Group (ADR) 56,319 97,300 Berlitz Int'l 16,300 38,145 Bethlehem Steel Corp* 645,703 591,861 Beverly Enterprises* 1,490,130 943,176 Black & Decker Corp* 5,872,918 4,710,697 Blackstone Adv Term 1,677 21,580 Blackstone Incm Trst 71,328 54,932 Blackstone Target Tr 69,477 54,896 Blockbuster Enter* 5,596,785 4,845,133 Blue Chip Value Fund 28,397 12,300 Boeing Company* 1,706,207 2,045,699 Boise Cascade Corp* 555,560 412,131 Borden Chem (units) 21,616 4,788 Borden Inc* 162,985 255,637 Briggs & Stratton* 889,734 798,655 Bristol-Myers Squibb* 4,248,691 4,119,897 British Airways(ADR) 71,770 85,370 British Petrol (ADR)* 651,127 563,305 Broad, Inc. 88,749 37,200 Brooklyn Union Gas 37,564 53,317 Browning Ferris Ind* 836,352 1,314,324 Brunswick Corp* 1,542,915 1,505,678 Brush Wellman Inc 76,800 64,600 Burlington Northern* 264,812 290,104 Burnham Pacif Prop* 133,452 122,682 Businessland, Inc.* 373,540 334,839 C&S/Sovran Corp* 1,781,693 1,105,300 C.R.

aVThe National Association of Securities Dealers yesterday reported an increase of slightly more than 3.6 percent in the short interest in actively traded over-the-counter securities in its national market system for the four weeks that ended on Nov. 15. A total of 304 million shares were held short and not yet covered in mid-November, it said, compared with a total of 293.3 million in the period that ended in mid-October. The November figure, an increase of 10.7 million shares, represents short selling in 2,284 stocks; in October, the short selling was spread among 2,298 issues.

VThe New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short by investors and not yet covered increased by 4.9 million shares, or slightly less than six-tenths of 1 percent, for the month ended Dec. 14. The new level is a record, but the increase was far smaller than the rise of 62.6 million shares, or 7.9 percent, for the month ended Nov. 15. The Big Board said that as of the December settlement date, 855.7 million shares were held in a short position, compared with an adjusted total of 850.8 million shares, the previous record level, on Nov. 15. The latest figure is equivalent to nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board. Amex Short Sales Decline Also for the period ended Dec. 14, the American Stock Exchange said the number of shares sold short declined by 306,409, to 83.2 million shares. That figure represented a decline of less than four-tenths of 1 percent from its record level at the Nov. 15 reporting period. The Nov. 15 total was adjusted to 83.5 million shares. A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and it normally represents speculation that the price of the stock will fall, since the seller makes a profit if the stock can be bought back at a lower price. The number of shares in which a short position is held by investors is totaled monthly by each exchange and by the National Association of Securities Dealers and represents the "short interest" for that period. Some analysts argue that a big drop in short interest is bullish, because it presumably means that many investors think the stock market will rise. Conversely, they say, a large rise in short interest would be bearish. Other analysts, however, argue that a large "overhang" of shares sold short is really a bullish sign, because those shares must eventually be bought back. In a rising market, short-sellers rushing to cover their positions could thus exert more upward pressure on prices. By this reasoning, a decrease in short interest is bearish. Value of Figure as an Indicator Is Questioned The debate has taken on a new twist in recent years as questions have arisen over the value of short interest as an indicator. That change is primarily the result of short-selling by arbitragers involved in special situations, including proposed or pending takeovers, convertible securities, rights offerings, stock splits or distributions and tenders. Short-interest figures may be even less meaningful, some experts say, if large institutional investors use short-selling to hedge risk in their portfolios. Seasonal variations may also skew the figures. For example, analysts note, there is often additional short-selling in December, related to end-of-year tax strategies. The following Big Board stocks showed changes in open short positions of 10,000 shares or more in the recent period: *3*Short Interest Security Name 12/14/90 11/15/90 A.L.

Are building stocks still a buy? ''As long as the general market keeps going up and interest rates keep going down, these stocks will continue to do well,'' said Jonathan Goldfarb, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who follows building-related issues as well as home builders. For 1986 through March 12, a group of five home builders - Centex, Kaufman & Broad, Pulte Home, Ryan Homes and U.S. Home - took top honors among 89 sectors monitored by Standard & Poor's Corporation. This volatile group rose 42.2 percent, against a 10.1 percent gain for the S.&P. 500-stock index.

The Dow Jones industrial average, after closing above the 1,800 barrier for the first time on Thursday, yesterday suffered its fourth worst decline, falling 35.68 points, to 1,768.56. The 199.2 million shares that traded represented the fourth-heaviest volume in New York Stock Exchange history. The reason for the tumult was an occurrence known on Wall Street as a ''triple witching hour,'' when contracts for three types of trading instruments - stock index options, stock index futures and individual stock options -expire simultaneously. Occurs Four Times a Year This event, which occurs four times a year, is an opportunity for the big institutions that trade in those instruments - those with at least $5 million to invest - to profit from price discrepancies in those types of investments.

VThe surge of corporate takeovers in recent years has produced a tangled, high-stakes dispute between the Treasury Department and dozens of corporations over the tax treatment of the companies they acquired. Companies that bought other companies face the possibility of having to pay hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars in back taxes because of how they handled the acquisitions on their tax returns. That unhappy prospect arose last January when the Treasury not only published a stiff set of tax regulations but also said it would apply these tough rules retroactively to acquisitions that had already taken place. Last week the Treasury granted something of a reprieve when, under heavy pressure from industry and its advisers, it said that it would not apply the new regulations retroactively. But Treasury officials warned that they intended to take a skeptical audit look at those past acquisitions, and according to Government officials, accounting experts, lawyers and corporate executives, scores of companies could ultimately still have to pay up.

VA boom in home construction across much of the country is spilling into other sectors, stimulating an otherwise languid economy, economists say. ''Housing is one of the few engines of the current economy,'' said Walter K. Joelson, chief economist of the General Electric Company. Because of the housing boom, G.E.'s sales of major appliances to contractors are running about 13 percent ahead of last year, he said. Indeed, many housing-related businesses have been showing healthy gains of late. The Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, for example, reports that its bathtubs, shower stalls, shingles and insulation are selling very well; the company's sales in the first quarter jumped 28 percent from the period last year. The Masco Corporation's faucet sales are up about 10 percent. And the paint store segment of the Sherwin-Williams Company enjoyed a 10.9 percent sales rise in the first quarter.

Nobody, however, could have dreamed up a tale like that of Sotheby's, the venerable auction house that Mr. Taubman saved in 1983. As if by magic, it recovered and prospered under Mr. Taubman's reign as chairman. It hit a rough patch in the early 1990's, along with the rest of his empire.

The increase was the second largest in the last six months, and seemed to reflect rising confidence among bears that the long-awaited, often-predicted market correction was beginning.

VShort-selling activity, usually done as a bet that stock prices will fall, rose significantly earlier this month, evidently as a result of the sharp fall in stock prices that followed the Federal Reserve's move to raise the Federal funds rate on Feb. 4. The New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the total short position in its stocks -- the number of shares borrowed and sold short, but not yet covered by repurchasing the shares -- rose 3.7 percent in the month that ended Feb. 8, to a record 1.32 billion shares. That was the largest increase in five months, perhaps reflecting renewed confidence among bears. At the American Stock Exchange, the short interest position rose 3.5 percent, to a record 104.9 million shares. It was the largest rise in three months on that exchange.
