VThe number of shares sold short on the New York Stock Exchange and not yet covered rose for the monthlong period ended Dec. 13 by 22 million, or 2.9 percent, to 784.4 million, from 762.4 million on Nov. 15, the Big Board reported yesterday. The figure had also risen in the previous period. The increases reversed a trend that had continued through most of the year, when the figure had been falling. The latest figure is still below the 1991 peak of 792.4 million shares in February, and it compares with 855.7 million shares at the end of December 1990.

aVThe New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short by investors and not yet covered increased by 4.9 million shares, or slightly less than six-tenths of 1 percent, for the month ended Dec. 14. The new level is a record, but the increase was far smaller than the rise of 62.6 million shares, or 7.9 percent, for the month ended Nov. 15. The Big Board said that as of the December settlement date, 855.7 million shares were held in a short position, compared with an adjusted total of 850.8 million shares, the previous record level, on Nov. 15. The latest figure is equivalent to nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board. Amex Short Sales Decline Also for the period ended Dec. 14, the American Stock Exchange said the number of shares sold short declined by 306,409, to 83.2 million shares. That figure represented a decline of less than four-tenths of 1 percent from its record level at the Nov. 15 reporting period. The Nov. 15 total was adjusted to 83.5 million shares. A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and it normally represents speculation that the price of the stock will fall, since the seller makes a profit if the stock can be bought back at a lower price. The number of shares in which a short position is held by investors is totaled monthly by each exchange and by the National Association of Securities Dealers and represents the "short interest" for that period. Some analysts argue that a big drop in short interest is bullish, because it presumably means that many investors think the stock market will rise. Conversely, they say, a large rise in short interest would be bearish. Other analysts, however, argue that a large "overhang" of shares sold short is really a bullish sign, because those shares must eventually be bought back. In a rising market, short-sellers rushing to cover their positions could thus exert more upward pressure on prices. By this reasoning, a decrease in short interest is bearish. Value of Figure as an Indicator Is Questioned The debate has taken on a new twist in recent years as questions have arisen over the value of short interest as an indicator. That change is primarily the result of short-selling by arbitragers involved in special situations, including proposed or pending takeovers, convertible securities, rights offerings, stock splits or distributions and tenders. Short-interest figures may be even less meaningful, some experts say, if large institutional investors use short-selling to hedge risk in their portfolios. Seasonal variations may also skew the figures. For example, analysts note, there is often additional short-selling in December, related to end-of-year tax strategies. The following Big Board stocks showed changes in open short positions of 10,000 shares or more in the recent period: *3*Short Interest Security Name 12/14/90 11/15/90 A.L.

VThe number of shares sold short and not covered between mid-July and mid-August on the New York Stock Exchange rose for the fifth straight monthly period, breaking its record high, the Big Board reported yesterday. The short positions, which traditionally indicate pessimism about the condition of the market among investors, ended the period at 907.1 million shares. That was an increase of 2.8 percent from the 882.6 million shares reported in the previous period, meaning that short interest has climbed 31.3 percent since March, when the figures began their recent growth.

VMany traders who had hoped to profit by betting against stocks they thought were overvalued were forced to run for cover again this month as share prices continued to rise. That trend was evident in figures released yesterday by the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange on the total number of shares that were sold short and not yet covered in the month ended Friday, Feb. 14. Though those "short interest" figures represent a tiny fraction of all the shares listed on those exchanges, they are an important measure of the overall bearishness of traders.

VThe number of shares sold short and not yet covered rose during the month ended April 8, the New York and American stock exchanges reported yesterday. Traders took advantage of a spate of secondary offerings, and the pressure they often put on stock prices, to bet against those stocks. On the Big Board, the figure was 718.7 million shares, up 4 percent, or 27.7 million, from early March. On the American Stock Exchange, the figure was 62.8 million, up 5.5 percent, or 3.3 million. The figures are totaled monthly by the two exchanges and the Nasdaq and represent the "short interest" for that period.

VGoaded along by a stock market that seems determined to test new highs, the number of shares sold short and not yet covered rose for the second straight month, both the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange said yesterday. According to traders, the market's contribution was twofold: It appeared to embolden short-sellers -- traders who look to profit by borrowing stocks they believe are overvalued so that they can sell them. As long as the shares can be bought back at a discount before they have to be replaced, the traders make money. And many of them stepped up their bets in areas like airlines, banks, and brokerages.
