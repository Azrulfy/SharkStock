VTrump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc., the flagship of Donald J. Trump's debt-laden casino holdings, reported increased losses for the second quarter and a dwindling supply of cash yesterday, leaving the struggling company in an increasingly perilous financial position. Beginning with Memorial Day weekend, the summer season typically is the most lucrative for casino companies because more people are on vacation and looking to gamble. But Trump Hotels lost $17.6 million, or 59 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $10 million, or 46 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
