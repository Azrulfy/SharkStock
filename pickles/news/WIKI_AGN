VDavid F. Woodward, a researcher at Allergan Inc., a manufacturer of eye care and skin care products, has patented a composition that could prove useful in treating glaucoma. Glaucoma, which can lead to blindness, occurs when pressure builds behind the eye because fluids are not draining properly. Although some treatments exist, their effectiveness is often uneven. Company officials said most treatments are based on inhibiting the formation of fluids. Some doctors are concerned that doing so may create other problems.

VThe shares of Allergan Inc. rose 7 percent on speculation the company may be acquired and optimism about new products in development. Allergan's shares rose $2.375, to $35.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said speculation that Allergan, which is based in Irvine, Calif., could be acquired was renewed after Hoechst A.G. said this week that it would pay $3.5 billion to buy the shares in the French drug maker Roussel Uclaf that it does not already own. Allergan is often the subject of takeover speculation because its market value of about $2.3 billion is relatively small for a pharmaceutical company. In addition, Allergan said its new treatment for psoriasis and acne, Zorac, had been approved for sale in Germany. Zorac is expected to be a major product for Allergan.

Effect of Merger With NCR Most of that decline in the A.T.& T. short position was related to the completion of the company's merger with the NCR Corporation.

As long as the shares can be bought back at a discount before they have to be replaced, the traders make money. And many of them stepped up their bets in areas like airlines, banks, and brokerages.

VIT was a typical workday for Howard C. Birndorf at Nanogen Inc., the biotechnology company he helped to found here three years ago. As he showed a visitor around, he met three new employees he had never seen before; introduced Harry Leonhardt, the general counsel hired a few days earlier from Allergan Inc.; wound through rooms of brand-new lasers, microscopes and beakers to a basketball court about to be turned into more laboratory space, and showed off an empty cubicle. ''This will be our C.F.O.'s office, when we have one,'' said Mr. Birndorf, chairman and chief executive of Nanogen, which is privately held.

VAllergan Inc., a manufacturer of eye- and skin-care products, said yesterday that discussions with Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. about a possible merger had been terminated because the proposed terms were "not feasible." Allergan made the announcement after The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Pharmacia & Upjohn was talking with Allergan about a takeover. Allergan said the discussions involved a possible stock-swap merger with "pooling of interest" accounting that would in theory have allowed greater profits than a cash deal would have allowed. "The pooling was feasible for Allergan, but not for Pharmacia & Upjohn," Jeff D'Eliscu, an Allergan spokesman, said. Following the release of Allergan's statement, Pharmacia & Upjohn issued a statement saying that it was aware of what Allergan had said and had no further comment. Allergan's shares rose 37.5 cents yesterday, to $38.25. Pharmacia & Upjohn's stock rose 62.5 cents, to $39.625.

VAllergan Inc. said yesterday that it was cutting 450 jobs from its staff of 6,000 to improve profit margins hurt by competition and acquisitions. The cuts will result in charges that will reduce pretax earnings by as much as $75 million, or 81 cents a share. Spun off from Smith Kline Inc. in 1989, Allergan made a series of acquisitions last year and expanded its operations in Asia and Latin America. But those moves added overhead while managed-care concerns have restrained sales growth. Allergan of Irvine, Calif., said the restructuring charges could be distributed in any or all of the second, third or fourth quarter. In 1995, Allergan profits were $72.7 million.

VAllergan, the maker of Botox antiwrinkle treatments, has agreed to buy Oculex Pharmaceuticals for $230 million to add drugs for treating eye diseases. Allergan has been shifting its focus to pharmaceutical sales after spinning off a business last year that makes eye-surgery devices. Oculex, which is closely held, develops products to treat eye diseases, Allergan said. The company expects to complete the purchase by the end of November. Allergan, which is based in Irvine, Calif., said it would record 75 percent to 90 percent of the purchase price as a research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2003. Oculex is based in Sunnyvale, Calif.

VThe New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short and not yet covered in the month ended Nov. 15 increased by 62.6 million, to a record level. The new total is 7.9 percent above the previous record, which was set a month earlier. The Big Board said that as of the November settlement date, a record 850.8 million shares were held in a short position -- sold "short" by investors and not yet covered -- compared with an adjusted total of 788.1 million shares on Oct. 15. The latest figure is equivalent to nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board. Also for the month ended Nov. 15, the American Stock Exchange reported its short sales outstanding rose by 680,700 million shares, to a record total of 81.7 million, an increase of less than 1 percent above the previous record total reported for the period ended Oct. 15. A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and it normally represents speculation that the price of the stock will fall, since a short-seller makes a profit if the stock can be bought at a lower price. Debate Over Meaning Some analysts argue that a big drop in short interest is bullish, because it presumably means that many investors think the stock market will rise. Conversely, they say, a large rise in short interest would be bearish. Other analysts, however, argue that a large "overhang" of shares sold short is really a bullish sign, because those shares must eventually be bought back. In a rising market, short-sellers rushing to cover their positions could thus exert more upward pressure on prices. By this reasoning, a decrease in short interest is bearish. The debate has taken on a new twist in recent years as questions have arisen over the value of short interest as an indicator. That change is primarily the result of short-selling by arbitragers involved in special situations, including proposed or pending takeovers, convertible securities, rights offerings, stock splits or distributions and tenders. Short interest figures may be even less meaningful, some experts say, if large institutional investors use short-selling to hedge risk in their portfolios. Seasonal variations may also skew the short-interest figures. For example, analysts note, there is often additional short-selling in December, related to end-of-the-year tax strategies. The number of shares in which a short position is held by investors is totaled monthly by each exchange, as well as by the National Association of Securities Dealers. The following Big Board stocks showed changes in open short positions of 10,000 shares or more in the recent period: *3*Short Interest Security Name 11/15/90 10/15/90 1838 Bond-Deb Tradng 10,442 0 AAR Corp 86,360 69,250 Abbott Labs* 1,420,148 1,545,892 ACM Govt Income* 238,933 5,370 Acuson Corp* 285,747 182,343 Adams Express* 324,348 313,497 Adobe Resources Corp 29,976 7,766 Advanced Micro Dev* 760,211 615,480 Aetna Life Casualty* 3,198,994 1,546,712 Ahmanson HF* 2,395,585 1,709,527 Air Products Chem* 187,646 151,702 Airborne Freight Cor 98,556 71,820 Alaska Air Group* 412,245 299,046 Albany Int'l Cl A* 125,000 107,200 Alberto Culver Cl B* 233,712 157,867 Albertson's Inc* 515,825 660,298 Alcan Aluminium Ltd.* 9,095,127 394,674 Alexanders Inc* 142,273 104,289 Allegheny Ludlum 87,642 42,949 Allegheny Pwr* 972,243 1,250,818 Allen Group Inc 54,712 68,586 Allergan, Inc.* 169,906 180,900 Alliance Capital Mgt 16,400 0 Alliant Techsystems 40,518 0 Allied-Signal Inc* 306,093 486,409 Allst Mun Inc Opp II 17,400 4,000 Allstate Mun Incm 12,004 1,902 Allstate Muni Prem 25,000 0 AM International* 122,482 134,832 Amdura Corp* 152,433 171,000 Amer Brands* 4,116,297 0 Amer Elec Pwr* 914,440 891,244 Amer Express Co* 3,628,937 3,370,554 Amer Family Corp* 279,296 220,328 Amer General* 215,013 430,810 Amer Health Prop 14,286 34,994 Amer President Co's* 214,856 166,914 Amer Real Estate, LP 1,000 13,600 Amer Savs Bk $1.8125* 202,699 224,299 Amer Stores Co* 130,984 115,452 Amer Tel & Tel* 4,352,238 4,456,819 Amer Waste Svcs Cl A 44,158 12,000 Amerada Hess Corp* 359,219 322,854 American Cyanamid Co* 243,880 306,349 American Intl Group* 1,361,089 1,399,246 American Savings Bk* 597,590 615,439 Ameriscribe Corp* 122,450 147,020 Ameritech* 1,607,976 1,630,808 Ames Dept Stores* 2,362,265 2,725,585 Ametek Inc* 102,922 114,714 Amoco Corp* 1,942,445 2,493,842 AMP Inc* 610,291 542,870 AMR Inc* 1,415,184 1,084,860 AMRE, Inc.* 611,600 649,600 Amsouth Bancorp 20,325 32,097 Anadarko Petroleum* 380,853 839,423 Angelica Corp 22,875 2,162 Anheuser Busch Co* 641,949 622,940 Aon Corp 28,319 4,087 Apache Corp* 354,595 89,375 Archer Daniels* 588,069 714,214 Arctic Alaska Fish* 423,750 324,350 Arkla, Inc* 2,642,224 1,588,771 Armstrong World Ind* 223,194 283,213 Arvin Ind,inc* 344,560 333,529 ASA Limited* 166,497 252,171 Asarco Inc* 103,047 136,337 Ashland Oil* 170,596 237,879 Asia Pacific Fund 27,871 16,171 Asset Invest Corp 37,927 1,365 Associated Natl Gas* 144,388 67,238 Atlantic Energy Inc.* 173,399 192,479 Atlantic Richfield* 1,142,835 1,377,144 Automatic Data Proc* 698,405 821,515 Avery Dennison Corp* 196,576 2,270,631 Avnet Inc 31,000 43,239 Avon Prods $2.00 E-R* 151,900 53,100 Avon Products* 363,667 566,982 Baker Hughes Inc* 1,394,883 1,694,418 Ball Corp 79,947 64,637 Bally Mfg Corp* 8,309,831 7,715,146 Balt Gas & Elec Co* 1,183,998 1,289,928 Baltimore Bancorp* 1,156,550 1,234,200 Banc One Corp* 1,186,119 1,289,911 Banco Cntrl (ADR) 11,664 0 Bandag Inc 82,713 72,025 Bank of Boston Corp* 9,056,380 9,514,488 Bank of New England* 5,851,080 7,919,405 Bank of New York* 928,075 844,749 Bank Tr NY* 1,003,331 944,244 Bankamerica Corp* 2,082,533 1,865,097 Barclays Bank ADR A 12,671 31,249 Barclays Plc (ADR) 300 23,764 Barnett Banks Inc* 2,948,194 1,863,855 Bass Plc (ADR) 26,784 901 Battle Mtn Gold* 260,740 212,850 Bausch & Lomb Inc* 369,423 320,633 Baxter Int'l Cv Exch 15,032 32 Baxter International* 3,643,500 3,850,604 Bear Stearns Co* 976,348 1,400,541 Bearings Inc 46,600 19,550 Beazer Plc (ADR)* 365,250 473,984 Beckman Instruments* 124,669 113,260 Bell Atlantic Corp* 1,850,118 1,405,221 Bellsouth Corp* 1,300,247 1,163,574 Bemis Co Inc 70,732 94,206 Beneficial Corp* 580,145 517,883 Benetton Group (ADR) 56,319 97,300 Berlitz Int'l 16,300 38,145 Bethlehem Steel Corp* 645,703 591,861 Beverly Enterprises* 1,490,130 943,176 Black & Decker Corp* 5,872,918 4,710,697 Blackstone Adv Term 1,677 21,580 Blackstone Incm Trst 71,328 54,932 Blackstone Target Tr 69,477 54,896 Blockbuster Enter* 5,596,785 4,845,133 Blue Chip Value Fund 28,397 12,300 Boeing Company* 1,706,207 2,045,699 Boise Cascade Corp* 555,560 412,131 Borden Chem (units) 21,616 4,788 Borden Inc* 162,985 255,637 Briggs & Stratton* 889,734 798,655 Bristol-Myers Squibb* 4,248,691 4,119,897 British Airways(ADR) 71,770 85,370 British Petrol (ADR)* 651,127 563,305 Broad, Inc. 88,749 37,200 Brooklyn Union Gas 37,564 53,317 Browning Ferris Ind* 836,352 1,314,324 Brunswick Corp* 1,542,915 1,505,678 Brush Wellman Inc 76,800 64,600 Burlington Northern* 264,812 290,104 Burnham Pacif Prop* 133,452 122,682 Businessland, Inc.* 373,540 334,839 C&S/Sovran Corp* 1,781,693 1,105,300 C.R.

VThe New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short by investors and not yet covered increased by 4.9 million shares, or slightly less than six-tenths of 1 percent, for the month ended Dec. 14. The new level is a record, but the increase was far smaller than the rise of 62.6 million shares, or 7.9 percent, for the month ended Nov. 15. The Big Board said that as of the December settlement date, 855.7 million shares were held in a short position, compared with an adjusted total of 850.8 million shares, the previous record level, on Nov. 15. The latest figure is equivalent to nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board. Amex Short Sales Decline Also for the period ended Dec. 14, the American Stock Exchange said the number of shares sold short declined by 306,409, to 83.2 million shares. That figure represented a decline of less than four-tenths of 1 percent from its record level at the Nov. 15 reporting period. The Nov. 15 total was adjusted to 83.5 million shares. A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and it normally represents speculation that the price of the stock will fall, since the seller makes a profit if the stock can be bought back at a lower price. The number of shares in which a short position is held by investors is totaled monthly by each exchange and by the National Association of Securities Dealers and represents the "short interest" for that period. Some analysts argue that a big drop in short interest is bullish, because it presumably means that many investors think the stock market will rise. Conversely, they say, a large rise in short interest would be bearish. Other analysts, however, argue that a large "overhang" of shares sold short is really a bullish sign, because those shares must eventually be bought back. In a rising market, short-sellers rushing to cover their positions could thus exert more upward pressure on prices. By this reasoning, a decrease in short interest is bearish. Value of Figure as an Indicator Is Questioned The debate has taken on a new twist in recent years as questions have arisen over the value of short interest as an indicator. That change is primarily the result of short-selling by arbitragers involved in special situations, including proposed or pending takeovers, convertible securities, rights offerings, stock splits or distributions and tenders. Short-interest figures may be even less meaningful, some experts say, if large institutional investors use short-selling to hedge risk in their portfolios. Seasonal variations may also skew the figures. For example, analysts note, there is often additional short-selling in December, related to end-of-year tax strategies. The following Big Board stocks showed changes in open short positions of 10,000 shares or more in the recent period: *3*Short Interest Security Name 12/14/90 11/15/90 A.L.

VAllergan Inc. plans to spin off a business that makes contact lenses and eye-surgery devices to concentrate on medicines that treat ailments including skin disease and muscular pain. The company intends to give shares in the new publicly traded entity, Advanced Medical Optics Inc., to Allergan investors by midyear. The eye-care unit had sales of $551 million last year, about a third of Allergan's total $1.69 billion. Allergan, based in Irvine, Calif., said the split would help increase per-share earnings growth at the drug unit by as much as 25 percent and revenue by more than 15 percent. The operations are moving in different directions, with medicine sales climbing 15 percent last year, while eye-care revenue fell 4.8 percent.

VBausch & Lomb Inc. said a federal judge dismissed a patent-infringement suit and cleared the way for the company to seek approval to sell a generic version of a rival's glaucoma treatment. The rival, Allergan Inc., sued Bausch & Lomb in January, accusing the company of infringing two patents Allergan owns relating to Alphagan, a brimonidine tartrate solution. A similar suit Allergan filed against Alcon Laboratories Inc. was dismissed last month, and Allergan said it would appeal both decisions.

VAllergan in Irvine, Calif., has selected agencies owned by the Grey Global Group in New York to handle the first marketing for Botox Cosmetic, the popular treatment for fighting wrinkles. Spending was estimated at $40 million to $50 million. The decision came just days after the Food and Drug Administration approved Botox for cosmetic use.

aVBotox, a wildly popular treatment for wrinkles, was approved yesterday by the Food and Drug Administration for cosmetic use to treat frown lines. The approval permits Allergan, the maker of Botox, to begin a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign aimed at doctors and consumers. Until now, because Botox had received regulatory approval as a treatment only for eye spasms and other neurological disorders, the drug's use as a cosmetic treatment has grown largely through word of mouth.

VFROM grapefruit-scented slimming creams to wrinkle-zapping laser beams, it would appear that no cosmetic treatment is too outlandish for the image conscious. But some investors have been peeling away the beauty industry's layers in hopes of improving the appearance of their portfolios. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, 8.5 million cosmetic procedures were performed last year, up 48 percent from 2000. The greatest volumes were nonsurgical treatments, including Botox, collagen and laser-based hair removal.
